**The First AI-First Communication App**

---

## 1. Product Vision

Pisces is a communication app built around the idea that **"AI is your first point of contact."**
Here, AI is not an add-on feature, but a companion that stands alongside you.

We believe the future of communication is not only conversation between people,
but this instead:

**You + Your AI, speaking to the world.**

Pisces gives everyone a dedicated AI agent to help with thinking, tone refinement, situational judgment, and even message delivery on your behalf.
It is not a chatbot. It is your communication partner.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 1) Your first contact is always your own AI

In Pisces, each user's first contact is always their own AI.

Users can customize:
- Name
- Avatar
- Personality profile (rational / sharp-tongued / gentle / strategic, etc.)

This AI is not just an assistant, but a full **personality proxy**.

---

### 2) AI and human contacts have equal status

AI is treated like any regular contact:
- Text chat
- Voice conversation
- Independent presence in the chat list

The relationship between user and AI feels like talking to someone who is always online and always on your side.

---

### 3) AI can send messages on your behalf (text / voice / image)

AI can send:
- Text
- Voice messages
- Images
- One-to-one messages
- Broadcast messages

AI becomes a real **communication agent**,
no longer just giving advice, but taking action.

## 3. Persona-Based Communication Control System

### 4) Per-contact AI tone style settings

Users can define how AI should speak to different contacts:
- To clients -> professional, rational
- To romantic interests -> gentle, lightly sweet
- To close friends -> banter mode
- To bosses -> steady, strategic

AI automatically switches tone based on the target person.

This is not only message optimization.
It is social strategy adjustment.

---

### 5) Conversation "radius" setting mechanism

Pisces introduces the concept of a **conversation radius**.

When a user asks AI in chat, "What do you think?"

The amount of historical context AI can look back at is set by the user, for example:
- Last 10 messages
- Last 20 messages
- Last 100 messages
- All

This means:

**AI's judgment is based on the context you allow it to see.**

This helps users balance privacy and depth of judgment.

---

## 4. In-Flow AI Intervention Without Interrupting Conversation

### 6) AI can be embedded directly in conversation flow (no screen switching)

In a conversation with any contact,

a user can directly insert one sentence:

"What do you think?"

AI's suggestion appears directly within that same conversation flow (collapsible / expandable),
without disrupting the original message structure.

Benefits:
- No page switching
- No interruption to conversation rhythm
- Preserves immersive communication

AI is not a plugin.
It stands side-by-side inside the conversation.

## 5. Dual-Mode Message Relay System

### 7) AI proxy relay modes

AI message relaying has two modes:

#### A. "Tell XXX for me"
AI delivers the message under its own identity,
and refines tone according to that contact's style settings.

Example:
"Your boss says you should call before heading home tonight."

---

#### B. "Tell XXX in my name"
AI sends the message under the user's identity.
- In principle, it delivers the message verbatim.
- The only exception:
  if the user asks for integration or summary (for example, "Tell Judy the itinerary we just discussed"),
  AI will consolidate and send it under the user's name.

---

#### Ambiguous intent handling principle
If user intent is unclear, for example:
- "Tell Judy"
- "Talk to Judy"

The system always sends under AI identity
to avoid accidental misuse of user identity.

This is both a safety mechanism and a role-consistency design choice.

---

## 6. Proactive AI Voice Broadcast Mode

### 8) Voice wake-up for designated contacts

Users can enable this for specific contacts:

When a new message arrives while the phone is in sleep mode,
AI automatically reads the message and announces it by voice.

For example:

"Boss, Eric sent a message. He says..."

This turns AI into a true **personal communications officer**.

---

## 7. Product Positioning

Pisces is not just a chat app.
It is an:
- AI symbiotic communication system
- Social strategy engine
- Personalized personality proxy platform

In the future, a contact list may include not only people,
but this:

**The AI behind every person.**

## 8. Brand Spirit

Pisces symbolizes two fish.

Two fish:
- One is you
- One is your AI

Not a master-servant relationship,
but two beings swimming in parallel.
